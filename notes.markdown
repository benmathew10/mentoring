Questions For First Session
---------------------------

What is the Graphical User Interface?
  A Graphical User Interface is a visual way of interacting with a
  computer using items such as windows, icons, and menus. The advantage of using
  a GUI is that information is usually presented more intuitively and gives
  people who don't really need to work in the Terminal (non-technical business
  people, for example), the ability to more intuitively grasp what the program
  does -- you can skim the menus and get a general sense of what the program is
  capable of, and you can leverage your familiarity of other GUIs, as their
  structure is usually quite similar.

What is a repository?
  A *repository* is a central location in which data is stored and managed.

What is the difference between GitHub and Git?
  - Git is a distributed version control system. *Distributed* means that copies
  of the project are usually stored in more than one computer. *Version control*
  is a system for keeping track of changes in your code. Git lets you work on the
  same project with other people in parallel -- you could be working on the same
  file as your friends at the same time, and it helps you incorporate the changes
  you and your friend has made.  You have a local copy of the project. Your friends
  have their own copies of the project. You can think of Github as the "glue". Once
  you are done making changes to a project, you can check to see if any of your
  friends have `push`ed their changes to Github. Then you can `pull` the changes
  and incorporate it into your own copy of the project. Once you are done
  incorporating the changes, you can then `push` to Github so that your friends
  can see your changes and work with the most up-to-date version of the project.
  In Github, you can store all kinds of projects in *repositories*.

How can you change the name of a file with a command?
  - See the manual page of `mv`. You can do that in the Terminal by typing `man mv`

How do you access the place where they are coding in the video?

What language of code are they using in the video?

How do you get Git at the command line?
  OSX usually already has it by default.

Why do they create Git projects via Terminal?
  Software developers like working in the Terminal because they generally make
  us more efficient. It lets us automate workflows. GUIs, on the other hand, are
  usually not great at automation. In th Terminal, we can write and execute
  programs that make our life easier. Plenty of us spend lots of our time in
  the command line, so becoming very familiar with the Terminal is a really
  good idea.

When I tried to find the difference between the `game_old` and `game_new`, I
got an error saying there is no such file or directory, even though I saved it
to my Downloads folder. Why?

Things I Learned:
ls, pwd, ls -la, ls -l, ls -a, cd, ., .., ~, vim, permissions, sudo, 

Git: git status, git commit -m "<message>", git log, git add <file>, git init, 
git remote add <remote name> <url>,
